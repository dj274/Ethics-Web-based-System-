3.6(a) when the 7 and 3 units are activated on the input layer, the numbers 7 and 3 are displayed on the panel,
however we notice the 7 seems to be much more clearer to see, as the activation value of 7 is 0.9843 and the
acyivation values of 3 is 0.9024, therefore the actication values of 7 is stronger. (b) this result is accounted
by activating 7 and 3 at once on the input layer, and as a result the output on the hidden layer activates three
and seven, each with an activation value of 0.9500 (c) when you change the value of g_bar_1 this can enhance the
the difference between the values. (d) this can be useful in cognition because it can make things more apparent
and more memorable

3.7 (a) the minimal number of units that need to be clamped to produce the pattern completiob to the full 8 is 8
