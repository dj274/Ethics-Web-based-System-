Q 3.10 (A) when we decrease the ff_hidden_g_bar_i,the effects it has on the hidden activation average is of both
the Hidden activation and the inhibiton activation is very apparent, the inhibition activation spikes higher when
ff_hidden_g_bar_i is 3 than 5, and the same goes with the hidden activation average, the inhibition activation
average minumum activation average is a little over 0.3 then the maximum is 0.8 (b) When we increase
ff_hidden_g_bar_i to 7 the Activaiton average is surprisingly apparent too, the activation starts taking place
at the cycle of 5, however, once it reachespast the cycle of 20, the activation of both the inhibation and
hidden start is more or less unchanging after every other cycle, with the hidden activatoin remaining at below 0.1
and the actication unit going above 0.1.

1 3.11 (A) the inhibititry neurons and the hidden neurons seem to be much more active, inhibition
activation reaches almost the average activation of 1, as well as hidden activatin average.
(c)the activation of the hidden neuron srtarts becomes active very much later than the inhibitory neurons, it 
becomes more active after 20 cycle but remains at a consant rate below 0.1 avtivation. Whereas the inhibition
neuron isactive very early when 2 Cycles pass, however after 10 Cycles it remains at a constant activation
average of just above 0.2
